#Rails-Yelp
This was a project set in week 8 at Makers Academy as our first introduction to using Rails. The project was set by our coach Alex Peattie. I shall be returning to the project at a later date but i wanted to study Michael Hartls Rails Tutorials first. When i return to the project i shall be focusing on the database aspect and also look at used Bootstrap to give the app a presentable interface. I would also like to have a look at implementing some Gems that enable me to give the app greater functionality.
